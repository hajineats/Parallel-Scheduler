## What we have done

During this meeting, there wasn't much discussion about the next few objectives of the project. In the last couple of days, we were having some problems with JavaFX as some of the team members were able to run the initial graph visualization, but some weren't due to some problem.

- We debugged the issues we were having, and tried to setup the configuration files such that it would properly run on all computers that have JDK version 8 installed.

Because the GUI development was going to begin soon, we collaborated and came to a conclusion regarding how we want to structure the files (such that it would be the easiest to work with).

## Upcoming next:

1. Work on the pruning techniques to make the algorithm efficient.
2. Create the bare-bones of the graphical user interface in this week.
   - This especially includes components such as CPU and RAM usage, because they can easily be implemented.
