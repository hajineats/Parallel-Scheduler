# Meeting minutes Tuesday 27 Jul

#### Attendees: Simon, Shrey, Hajin, Josh, Oscar

## What we have done

Upon discovering that we need to produce a short report on the WBS, Network Diagram and the Gantt Chart, we spontaneously decided to have this meeting.

1. Discussed what kind of content should be added to the report, and worked on a [shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEyu6XGKlh_K195Np0fdagF7atMCj_KlVInAamJC3jg/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Added the critical path indicator to the Gantt chart and cleaned up the WBS and Network Diagram.

3. Created a breakdown of the classes we would need in order to implement a basic feasible algorithm e.g. Edge, GraphParser, Graph, Node.

4. Went through pseudo-code for the algorithm, trying to understand the cost function and other heuristics.

The task delegation remained same as the previous meeting:

- Simon and Oscar: Parse dot file
- <s>Shrey and Hajin: Parse commandline arguments</s>
- Oscar, Josh, Simon: Algorithm
- Shrey, Hajin, Josh: Lo-fi Design

The next meeting on 29th July will be a checkpoint meeting to discuss our progress with the rest of the team members. The final meeting to conclude the Design phase will be held on 30th July.

## Upcoming next:

1. Work on the project according to the task delegation
2. Share the progress with the team on Thursday
3. Submit the Planning
