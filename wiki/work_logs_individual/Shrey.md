- Helped the group finalize the Work Breakdown Structure, and Network Diagram.
- Started working on the low-fidelity prototype for the GUI.
- Designed an architecture for the command-line input and argument parsing.
- Implemented the `Config` class using the `commons-cli` library.
  - It would read the string argument, and produce a `Config` instance from that.
  - The creation of the class was supported by test-driven development, using the created test suite.

- For the Planning report, I wrote the description of our Network Chart and helped finalize it for submission.
- Assisted the group in creating a generic class structure, required to represent the graph states later on.
