# Meeting minutes Thurs 22 Jul

#### Attendees: Simon, Shrey, Hajin, Josh, Oscar

## What we have done

We are currently at a planning stage, following the spirit of Waterfall workflow model. 

1. WBS drawn on Lucidchart  [Link to WBS Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/689ad727-3cdc-44c2-9ba2-a9e82cee00e4/edit?fbclid=IwAR0DvzztNrKMUtdETzYDCuu1WtmjwBMr_lwNKG9wH5Nk5XF1twhpWvyNznY&shared=true&page=0_0#)
2. Network Diagram drawn on Lucidchart  [Link to Network Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/fe6d647e-d21a-4050-974a-ff71bf8e0055/edit?fbclid=IwAR26USFkMHwk6FPFSFN80phahrjVSz7ZRq5VgVg7thZw5KtHUEFQQPygx6E&shared=true&page=0_0#)

Here are some clarifications we had by visiting Oliver during his office hour:

1. Give some leniency to the Gantt chart schedule
2. You can assume that any implementation task implicitly has unit testing (so we don't need unit testing following every task)

## Upcoming next:

1. Make sure WBS and Network diagram are complete
2. Then move onto **Gantt Chart**
3. Each person can **research** scheduling algorithms and **share** it with the rest of the group in the next meeting
4. The next meeting is likely to be next Monday (**26 Jul**)
