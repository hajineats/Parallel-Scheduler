# Meeting minutes Thursday 19 Aug

#### Attendees: Simon, Shrey, Hajin, Josh, Oscar

## What we have done

- A bug detected in the current algorithm implementation.
- Figured out a feasible plan of merging `faulty-branch`, `feat-inputGraph`,`feat-screen` to the `main` branch. The order will be: 
  1. Josh and Shrey merge faulty into and screen into main
  2. Simon merge inputGraph to main 
  3. Oscar and Hajin continue with the latest main
- An update of each memeber's progress, discussion about information that are wanted to be visualized from the algorithm, such as number of states etc.
- An brief summary of new added features of showing total time usage of the algorithm and resizing the input graph. 

## Upcoming next:

1. Fix the identified bug
2. Add in the visualization of showing number of states in real time
3. branch merging
