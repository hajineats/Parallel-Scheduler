### 26 Jul
- Consolidated WBS, Network diagram
- Finished Gantt chart with the team
- Wrote [meeting minutes](../minutes/26-Jul.md)
- Structured packages for the project
- Created Config class with getters and setters that will store various configuration states (whether the program has visualisation, 
- Added test cases to ParserTest class to test command line input parsing. This is to check that the program processes arguments as intended, and whether it handles erratic cases (eg: whether default values are assigned to configuration if no argument is provided, whether exception is raised for inappropriate patterns of command input) 

### 22 Jul

- Discussed about the project requirement with the team member and collaborated with others in the making of WBS and Network Diagram
- Organised wiki structure (minutes, work log), and wrote [meeting minutes](../minutes/22-Jul.md) 
- A research into a suitable algorithm is in the process, where I would initially want to understand [Oliver Sinnen's paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054813002542?fbclid=IwAR34tKob8V73ri4qL_I9PzJsxBY6pRtJBb9p9BU3K9NPu17-C4UdpLRiWNg)
  - A part of this is A* algorithm
    - this was good for intuition of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySN5Wnu88nE 
    - this was good for pseudocode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE
